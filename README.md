Let assume, you've got a 50+ comments on your current pull request, and not every comment is automatically hidden by GitHub after your changes (because e.g. it refers to something different than the line of code it's commenting).

So, instead of scrolling through every comment, this extension allows you to manually end the conversation (i.e. collapse it).

The number next to the button describes the amount of comments in current section.

Also, when someone will write a comment on collapsed conversation, the extension will notify that with a beautiful **#nope** (a.k.a. _It's not over, bro!_) indicator and a danger-type button.

Build on top of GitHub's [Primer CSS framework](http://primercss.io/) so it looks very _github-ish_.
